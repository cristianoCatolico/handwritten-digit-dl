# Deep learning model for Handwritten Digit Image Classification
Deep learning (DL), a sub area of Machine learning (ML) provides different models that depending of case have better results. In case of Handwritten Digit, a simple CNN obtains good results. With models of ML, we can obtain such results but with different optimizations. We choose a CNN model since it is used for images. We have test with one convolutional layer, then two layers. Also, we have added a fully connected layer. During the training phase we observed that with 2 convolutional layers results the accuracy increased near to 100%. We have use activation functions such as ReLU because it enhances the result. 

In all cells, we have use PEP8 style. We have develop an application that use this model. We observe that since in test we obtain good accuracy, with new images the result is not always good since the patterns for digits can have different variations.

We have use python 3.10 for this project.
